## Project Setup

### Pre-requisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your local environment. If not, download it.

### Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-projects.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd react-projects
   ```
   
3. Install dependencies (make sure you have Node.js installed):

   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:`

   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open the app in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:

- React.js: The main JavaScript library used for building the app.

- JavaScript (ES6): For dynamic interactions and functionality.

- HTML5: For structuring the content.

- CSS3: For styling and responsiveness.

### Development Tools:

- Node.js & npm: For package management and local development.

- Create React App: To set up the React development environment.

## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js              # Main React component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css             # Styling for the app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js            # Main entry point for the app
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Project metadata and dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Project readme

```

- App.js: Contains the core logic and functionality of the app (task management).
- App.css: Styles the app to provide a clean and simple user interface.
- index.js: Entry point that renders the React app to the DOM.

## How to Use

### Add a Task:

Enter your task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

### Edit a Task:

Click the "Edit" button next to a task to modify it. A prompt will appear where you can update the task.

### Delete a Task:

Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

## Conclusion 

The To-Do App project shows how React.js can be used to build a simple and responsive task management tool. Users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks, with a clean and user-friendly interface. It's a great starting point for learning React and can be expanded with more features.

Happy Learning! ðŸ˜Š
